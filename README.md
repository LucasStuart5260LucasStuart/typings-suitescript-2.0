# SuiteScript 2.0 Typings

## Installation Instructions

To install the typings into your TypeScript project, you will first need to make sure you have definitions for the Promise types. Install that with this command:

`typings install --save --global dt~es6-promise`

Now you're ready for the SuiteScript typings file. Install that with this command:

`typings install --save github:headintheclouddev/typings-suitescript-2.0`
